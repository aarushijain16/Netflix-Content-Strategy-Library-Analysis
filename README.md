# Netflix Content Strategy & Library Analysis
## *Power BI dashboard project analysing content mix, genre trends, and global distribution*
# Overview

This project demonstrates how content library data can be analysed to support content strategy, portfolio planning, and global distribution decisions for a streaming platform.

Working with publicly available Netflix datasets, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyse content distribution across movies vs TV shows, release year trends, genres, ratings, and geographic reach.

Using:

- Power BI data modelling and dashboarding

- Content type, genre, and rating analysis

- Time-based trend analysis by release year

- Geographic analysis by country and director

The goal was to translate raw content metadata into strategic insights that help understand audience preferences, content investment trends, and Netflix’s global content footprint.

# Business Problem

Streaming platforms manage large and diverse content libraries, but often lack clarity on how content mix and distribution evolve over time.

Key challenges addressed:

- Limited visibility into content composition (movies vs TV shows)

- Difficulty identifying high-performing genres and content trends

- Lack of geographic perspective on content sourcing

- Over-reliance on aggregate content counts without strategic context

Key questions addressed:

- How is Netflix’s content library structured today?

- How has content strategy evolved over time?

- Which genres dominate the platform’s catalogue?

- How globally diverse is the content library?

# Solution Approach

I designed a Power BI dashboard to transform raw Netflix content data into insight-led views for strategic analysis.

🔹 Data Integration & Modelling

- Integrated multiple Netflix datasets (content details, genres, ratings, directors, countries)

- Established relationships across datasets using release year and content attributes

- Cleaned missing values and standardised categorical fields

🔹 Content Portfolio Analysis

- Analysed total content volume and split between Movies and TV Shows

- Evaluated content growth trends over release years

- Identified shifts in content strategy over time

🔹 Genre & Rating Insights

- Analysed genre distribution to identify dominant and emerging categories

- Evaluated content ratings to understand audience targeting and maturity levels

🔹 Geographic & Creator Analysis

- Analysed content distribution across countries

- Identified top directors by country and content type

- Assessed global diversity of content sourcing

🔹 Dashboard Design

- Built interactive KPI cards, trend charts, bar charts, and maps

- Designed for business users, not analysts

- Enabled quick exploration and filtering

# Key Business Insights and Strategic Impact
*(Translated for content, strategy, and leadership teams)*

- Netflix’s library is movie-heavy, but TV shows are growing faster
 → Indicates increasing focus on episodic content for retention

- Content production increased sharply post-2010

# Strategic Recommendations

- Maintain a balanced investment between movies and high-impact TV series

- Use genre insights to identify over- and under-invested categories

- Expand regional content sourcing in high-growth markets

- Align future content strategy with audience maturity preferences

- Use content analytics as a continuous planning tool, not static reporting

# Tools and Technologies

- Power BI – data modelling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards

- Netflix datasets – publicly available Kaggle CSV files
